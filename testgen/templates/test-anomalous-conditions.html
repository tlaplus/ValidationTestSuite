These are test cases to check the TLA+ Model Checker behavior under anomalous operating conditions.
These tests use the same model, but checking of the model is performed under specific conditions,
where where computational resources (depending on the test case) are not enough to complete the
task successfully.
Main objective of these tests is to ensure that the tool is capable to detect and report such
situations. Thus expecting outcome is <span class="keyword">crash</span> for all the cases.
