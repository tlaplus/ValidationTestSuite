This page is an index of feature combinations, which were skipped by the test generator.

How to use this index:

  <li>
    This index list all the features
  </li>
  <li>
    A feature can be either <span class="keyword">case</span> or
    <span class="keyword">plug</span>. Note that the same feature can be
    <span class="keyword">case</span> in one test case and <span class="keyword">plug</span> in the
    other
  </li>
  <li>
    Column <b>Case Index</b> allows to see all the skipped feature pairs, where a given feature
    participates as <span class="keyword">case</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    Column <b>Plug Index</b> allows to see all the skipped feature pairs, where a given feature
    participates as <span class="keyword">plug</span>
  </li>

  <table class="spec-table">
  <tr>
    <th>
        Case Index
    </th>
    <th>
        Plug Index
    </th>
  </tr>
  {% for feature in features %}
    <tr>
        <td>
            <a href={{ index_refs.cases_skipped[feature] }}><span class="keyword">{{ feature }}</span></a>
        </td>
        <td>
            <a href={{ index_refs.plugs_skipped[feature] }}><span class="keyword">{{ feature }}</span></a>
        </td>
    </tr>
