This page is an index of all test cases, produced by pairwise combining of the TLA+ language
features. Feature is an operator, constant, variable, or other TLA+ language construct, which is
required by the use cases.

How to use this index:

  <li>
    This index list all the features
  </li>
  <li>
    In generated test cases, a feature can be either <span class="keyword">case</span> or
    <span class="keyword">plug</span>. Note that the same feature can be
    <span class="keyword">case</span> in one test case and <span class="keyword">plug</span> in the
    other
  </li>
  <li>
    Column <b>Case Index</b> allows to see all test cases, where a given feature
    participates as <span class="keyword">case</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    Column <b>Plug Index</b> allows to see all test cases, where a given feature participates as
    <span class="keyword">plug</span>
  </li>
